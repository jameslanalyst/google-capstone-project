# Google Capstone Project - Cyclistic

Capstone Case Study from Google Data Analytics Certification

## About Cyclistic
Cyclistic is a bike-share program in Chicago with 5,824 bikes and 692 geotracked stations. The marketing strategy initially focused on raising general awareness and targeting broad consumer segments. Their pricing plans offered single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships, categorizing customers into casual riders and Cyclistic members based on their purchase choices. 

Financial analysis revealed annual members as more profitable than casual riders, prompting a shift in focus. Director Moreno aims to convert casual riders, who already know Cyclistic, into members. The plan involves leveraging historical bike trip data to identify trends and inform marketing strategies for successful conversion.

## My Role

I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing  believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

Business Statement: By identifying how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic differently, we can create a marketing campaign that targets casual riders and converts them into annual members. 

*Below I will describe the process I used step-by-step in this project.*

## Process

Overview: I downloaded and reviewed all of the data separately (12 months of data) in Google Sheets, then used Microsoft SQL to analyze the data as a whole year. Lastly, I created a dashboard in Tableau to present my analysis.

### Step 1: Download the Data

I downloaded the most recent data from the Data source and imported them into Google Sheets. 

The data was organized monthly and contained the following columns.


| Column  | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| ride_id  | The ID for each ride  |
| rideable_type  | The type of bike used  |
| started_at  | The date and time when the ride started  |
| ended_at  | The date and time when the ride ended  |
| start_station_name  | Name of the station where the ride started  |
| start_station_id  | ID of the station where the ride started  |
| end_station_name  | Name of the station where the ride ended  |
| end_station_id  | ID of the station where the ride ended  |
| start_lat  | The latitude of the station where the ride started  |
| start_lng  | The longitude of the station where the ride started  |
| end_lat  | The latitude of the station where the ride ended  |
| end_lng  | The longitude of the station where the ride ended  |
| member_casual  | The membership type of the rider  |



The timeframe for the data that was downloaded was from July 2022 to June 2023, which is a 12-month period.

I wanted to review the data in google sheets to see which tool I preferred to use. After seeing that each spreadsheet had over a hundred thousand rows, I knew it would be more efficient to work with this data using SQL.


### Step 2: Import into SQL Server Management Studio and join the tables.

I Imported the CSV files into SQL Server Management Studio and created a table where I could join all the tables into one.

```sql
--- Created a Table that will hold all the tables together.

CREATE TABLE cyclistic_trip_last_12m
	(ride_id nvarchar(50),
	rideable_type nvarchar(50),
	started_at datetime2,
	ended_at datetime2,
	start_station_name nvarchar(100),
	start_station_id nvarchar(50),
	end_station_name nvarchar(100),
	end_station_id nvarchar(50),
	start_lat float,
	start_lng float,
	end_lat float,
	end_lng float,
	member_casual nvarchar(50)
	);

```

Once the table was created, I merged the past 12 months into a single table.

```sql

/*

Inserted all the tables using a Union All statement into the newly created table with 5,779,444 rows

*/

INSERT INTO cyclistic_trip_last_12m
SELECT * 
FROM divvy_trip_2022_07
UNION ALL
SELECT * 
FROM divvy_trip_2022_08
UNION ALL
SELECT * 
FROM divvy_trip_2022_09
UNION ALL
SELECT * 
FROM divvy_trip_2022_10
UNION ALL
SELECT * 
FROM divvy_trip_2022_11
UNION ALL
SELECT * 
FROM divvy_trip_2022_12
UNION ALL
SELECT * 
FROM divvy_trip_2023_01
UNION ALL
SELECT * 
FROM divvy_trip_2023_02
UNION ALL
SELECT * 
FROM divvy_trip_2023_03
UNION ALL
SELECT * 
FROM divvy_trip_2023_04
UNION ALL
SELECT * 
FROM divvy_trip_2023_05
UNION ALL
SELECT * 
FROM divvy_trip_2023_06;


```

### Step 3: Cleaning and Transforming the Data

The first thing I wanted to check for was duplicates.

```sql

/*

Wrote this query to ensure there were no duplicate ride_ids, start_station_id, end_station_id

*/
	
SELECT 
	 ride_id, 
	 start_station_id, 
	 end_station_id, 
	 COUNT(*) AS dup_count
FROM cyclistic_trip_last_12m
GROUP BY 
	ride_id, 
	 start_station_id, 
	 end_station_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

```
While going combing through the data, I noticed two things.
1. There are ```NULL``` in the dataset.
2. A few of the ```start_station``` and ```end_station``` indicated that these were maintenance or test rides.

These data points were removed from the dataset to ensure accuracy for our analysis.

Next, I deleted for NULLS as it is incomplete data

```sql
/*

Delete from table where data is NULL. (1369973 rows affected)

*/

DELETE FROM
	cyclistic_trip_last_12m
WHERE 
	ride_id IS NULL
	OR
	rideable_type IS NULL
	OR
	started_at IS NULL
	OR
	ended_at IS NULL
	OR
	start_station_id IS NULL
	OR
	start_station_name IS NULL
	OR
	end_station_id IS NULL
	OR
	end_station_name IS NULL
	OR
	start_lat IS NULL
	OR
	start_lng IS NULL
	OR
	end_lat IS NULL
	OR
	end_lng IS NULL
	OR
	member_casual IS NULL;

/*

Delete from the table where the start or end station is a maintenance site for Cyclistic. (1356 rows affected)

*/

DELETE FROM 
	cyclistic_trip_last_12m
WHERE
	(start_station_id LIKE '%TEST%')
	OR
	(end_station_id LIKE '%TEST%')
	OR
	(start_station_name LIKE '%TEST%')
	OR
	(end_station_name LIKE '%TEST%');

```

My first calculation was to determine how long each ride lasted and I wanted to add this to the table

```sql

ALTER TABLE
	cyclistic_trip_last_12m
ADD ride_length_minutes INT;

UPDATE cyclistic_trip_last_12m
SET ride_length_minutes = DATEDIFF(MINUTE, started_at, ended_at);

```

When I skimmed through the results of the ride lengths, I noticed that some ```ride_length_minutes``` were 0, negative or exceeded 24 hours. 

I wanted to further investigate so I dug deeper into the ```ride_length_minutes``` by looking at the max in minutes and the minimum in seconds.

```sql

-- Max ride length for each group in minutes

SELECT 
	member_casual,
	MAX(ride_length_minutes) as max_ride_length_minutes
FROM
	cyclistic_trip_last_12m
GROUP by member_casual;


--Min ride length for each group in seconds

SELECT 
	member_casual,
	MIN(DATEDIFF(SECOND, started_at, ended_at)) as min_ride_length_seconds
FROM
	cyclistic_trip_last_12m
GROUP BY
	member_casual;


```

I decided to remove ride lengths that exceeded 24 hours because those bikes were deemed lost/stolen. [source](https://help.divvybikes.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033484791-What-if-I-keep-a-bike-out-too-long-)
I also removed the rides with negative values and 0 seconds.

```sql

/*

Delete negative values of ride_length_minutes and ride_length_minutes that exceed 1440 minutes(24 hours). (443 rows affected)

*/

DELETE FROM
	cyclistic_trip_last_12m

WHERE 
	DATEDIFF(MINUTE, started_at, ended_at) >1440
	OR
	DATEDIFF(MINUTE, started_at, ended_at) < 0
	OR
	DATEDIFF(SECOND, started_at, ended_at) <= 0;


```

## Step 4: Analyze the data

I began my analysis by looking for simple insights such as ***total rides*** and ***average ride lengths per rider type***

I started with the ***total number of rides*** from July 2022 to June 2023

```sql

-- Average ride length for each group in minutes & all riders

SELECT 
    CASE WHEN GROUPING(member_casual) = 1 THEN 'all_rider' ELSE member_casual END AS member_casual,
    AVG(ride_length_minutes) AS average_ride_length_minutes
FROM
    cyclistic_trip_last_12m
GROUP BY 
    ROLLUP (member_casual);


```

Next was to determine the ***busiest day*** for rides per rider type

```sql

-- Counts total rides per weekday for each rider type, ranks them in order, then assigns the name of the week.

WITH Common_Ride_Day AS (
    SELECT
        COUNT(*) AS ride_count,
        member_casual,
        DATEPART(WEEKDAY, started_at) AS start_weekday
    FROM
        cyclistic_trip_last_12m
    GROUP BY
        member_casual,
        DATEPART(WEEKDAY, started_at)
),
RankedRides AS (
    SELECT
        ride_count,
        member_casual,
        start_weekday,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY member_casual ORDER BY ride_count DESC) AS rn
    FROM
        Common_Ride_Day
)
SELECT
    ride_count,
    member_casual,
    start_weekday,
    CASE WHEN start_weekday = 1 THEN 'Sunday'
         WHEN start_weekday = 2 THEN 'Monday'
         WHEN start_weekday = 3 THEN 'Tuesday'
         WHEN start_weekday = 4 THEN 'Wednesday'
         WHEN start_weekday = 5 THEN 'Thursday'
         WHEN start_weekday = 6 THEN 'Friday'
         WHEN start_weekday = 7 THEN 'Saturday'
    END AS start_ride_day_name
FROM
    RankedRides
WHERE
    rn = 1;



-- Calculates total ride per day for rider types

SELECT
    member_casual,
    ride_day_name,
    total_rides_per_day
FROM (
    SELECT
        member_casual,
        CASE WHEN start_weekday = 1 THEN 'Sunday'
             WHEN start_weekday = 2 THEN 'Monday'
             WHEN start_weekday = 3 THEN 'Tuesday'
             WHEN start_weekday = 4 THEN 'Wednesday'
             WHEN start_weekday = 5 THEN 'Thursday'
             WHEN start_weekday = 6 THEN 'Friday'
             WHEN start_weekday = 7 THEN 'Saturday'
        END AS ride_day_name,
        COUNT(*) AS total_rides_per_day
    FROM (
        SELECT
            member_casual,
            DATEPART(WEEKDAY, started_at) AS start_weekday,
            DATEDIFF(MINUTE, started_at, ended_at) AS ride_length_minutes
        FROM
            cyclistic_trip_last_12m
    ) AS Rides
    GROUP BY
        member_casual,
        start_weekday
) AS AvgRidePerWeekday
ORDER BY
    member_casual,
    total_rides_per_day DESC;


```

I also wanted to know the ***average length of rides*** per rider throughout the week.

```sql

-- Calculates average ride length per day for rider type 

SELECT
    member_casual,
    ride_day_name,
    average_ride_length_minutes
FROM (
    SELECT
        member_casual,
        CASE WHEN start_weekday = 1 THEN 'Sunday'
             WHEN start_weekday = 2 THEN 'Monday'
             WHEN start_weekday = 3 THEN 'Tuesday'
             WHEN start_weekday = 4 THEN 'Wednesday'
             WHEN start_weekday = 5 THEN 'Thursday'
             WHEN start_weekday = 6 THEN 'Friday'
             WHEN start_weekday = 7 THEN 'Saturday'
        END AS ride_day_name,
        AVG(ride_length_minutes) AS average_ride_length_minutes
    FROM (
        SELECT
            member_casual,
            DATEPART(WEEKDAY, started_at) AS start_weekday,
            DATEDIFF(MINUTE, started_at, ended_at) AS ride_length_minutes
        FROM
            cyclistic_trip_last_12m
    ) AS CasualRides
    GROUP BY
        member_casual,
        start_weekday
) AS AvgRidePerWeekday
ORDER BY
    member_casual,
    average_ride_length_minutes DESC;

```

Next, it was important to determine which ***parts of the day and seasons were the busiest***.

```sql

-- How do time, day, and month affect the rider type

SELECT
    member_casual,
    ride_day_name,
    ride_month_name,
    ride_hour,
	--seasons
    CASE
        WHEN ride_month IN (12, 1, 2) THEN 'Winter'
        WHEN ride_month IN (3, 4, 5) THEN 'Spring'
        WHEN ride_month IN (6, 7, 8) THEN 'Summer'
        ELSE 'Fall'
    END AS season,
	-- daytime
    CASE
        WHEN ride_hour BETWEEN 0 AND 11 THEN 'Morning'
        WHEN ride_hour BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
        ELSE 'Evening'
    END AS time_of_day,
    COUNT(*) AS ride_count
FROM (
    SELECT
        member_casual,
        DATEPART(MONTH, started_at) AS ride_month,
        DATEPART(HOUR, started_at) AS ride_hour,
        DATENAME(WEEKDAY, started_at) AS ride_day_name,
        DATENAME(MONTH, started_at) AS ride_month_name
    FROM
        cyclistic_trip_last_12m
) AS RideData
GROUP BY
    member_casual,
    ride_month,
    ride_hour,
    ride_day_name,
    ride_month_name
ORDER BY
    member_casual,
    season,
    time_of_day,
    ride_month,
    ride_day_name,
    ride_hour;

```

Because I have geographic locations, it would be helpful to determine which ***stations are the busiest***. 


```sql

SELECT
    COUNT(start_station_name) as most_frequent_start_location,
	start_station_name,
    member_casual
FROM
    cyclistic_trip_last_12m
GROUP BY
    start_station_name,
    member_casual
ORDER BY
    COUNT(start_station_name) DESC;

-- Common end location

SELECT
    COUNT(end_station_name) as most_frequent_end_location,
	end_station_name,
    member_casual
FROM
    cyclistic_trip_last_12m
GROUP BY
    end_station_name,
    member_casual
ORDER BY
    COUNT(end_station_name) DESC;

```

And lastly, I wanted to determine if riders had a ***preference for bike type***.

```sql

-- Do users have a preference for bike type?

SELECT
	rideable_type,
	COUNT(*) as total_rides_by_ride_type,
	member_casual
FROM
	cyclistic_trip_last_12m
GROUP BY
	rideable_type,
	member_casual
ORDER BY
	total_rides_by_ride_type;

```

## Step 4: Create a Visualization

Please refer to [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/CyclisticDashboardVersion2/Dashboard2?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) for the visualization

## Step 5: My recommendations
1. Develop a marketing campaign that targets casual riders during the summer months. Begin testing creatives and offers in May and ramp up in June through July. Specifically, I would increase marketing efforts during the weekend and evening when casual rider activities peak.
2. Offer an incentive that saves casual riders money when signing up for an annual membership during the weekend.
3. Increase non-member prices during peak times (evening) which should trigger customers to take advantage of saving opportunities by switching to an annual membership.
